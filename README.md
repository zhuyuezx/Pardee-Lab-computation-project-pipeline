Working with GFP1-10 and GFP11. 

## Data:
- aa_sequence -> Amino Acid Sequences in single letter
- alphafold_structural_pdbs -> Protein structure prediction from AplhaFold
- alphafold_multimer -> protein complex prediction from AlphaFold Multimer
- cores -> computed scores from SPServer
- test_structures -> verified protein complex structures from Protein Data Bank 

- multimer_results -> results of original GFP1-10 + GFP11 with high brightness
- mass_prediction -> all 16 * 20 predictions of single point mutation of GFP11
- high_brigtness -> prediction results of high brightness GFP11 sequence, 109 in total
